# Contributing to DDR5 AI Sandbox Simulator

We love your input! We want to make contributing to DDR5 AI Sandbox Simulator as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

* Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
* Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
* Include docstrings for all classes and functions
* Keep line length to 79 characters
* Use meaningful variable and function names

## Testing

* Write unit tests for new features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Maintain test coverage above 80%

## License

## Report Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

1. Check if the feature has already been requested
2. Provide a clear description of the feature
3. Explain why this feature would be useful
4. Consider offering to implement the feature yourself
