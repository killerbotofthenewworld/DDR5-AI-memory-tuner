# 🚀 DDR5 AI Sandbox Simulator - Comprehensive Improvement Roadmap

## 📋 Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvement plan for the DDR5 AI Sandbox Simulator, focusing on enhancing AI capabilities, testing, documentation, and user experience.

## 🛠️ 2025 Q3 Upgrade Execution Plan (Next 2 Weeks)

This section turns the roadmap into an actionable, time-bound plan. Dates assume start week of Aug 11, 2025. Adjust as needed.

### Week 1: Foundation, CI, and Installer Hardening

- CI/CD and Quality Gates

	- [ ] Validate existing workflow at `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` and set required checks on PRs
	- [ ] Add local quality tooling: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `mypy.ini`, `.flake8` (align with CI)
	- [ ] Introduce `requirements-dev.txt` (pytest, black, flake8, mypy, bandit, safety) and optional `constraints.txt`
	- [ ] Enable coverage artifact upload and failing threshold in CI (soft-fail today → hard-fail >2 weeks)

- Windows Installer (real, easy, robust)

	- [ ] Promote current per-user installer to a signed EXE via Inno Setup or NSIS (keeps venv layout)
	- [ ] Bundle an offline wheels cache for heavy deps (torch, torchvision, opencv) to reduce install flakiness
	- [ ] Add a “Repair” option and better logs; ensure Start Menu/Uninstall entries are present and reliable
	- [ ] Document code signing workflow and publish checksum in Releases

Deliverables (end of Week 1):

- Green CI on main for 3.9–3.12, pre-commit ready for contributors
- Windows EXE installer artifact attached to a draft GitHub Release, with install/uninstall verified

### Week 2: Performance, Safety, and AI Quick Wins

- Performance and Startup

	- [ ] Profile cold start; lazy-import heavy modules; cache static datasets (e.g., databases under `src/`)
	- [ ] Add a simple on-disk cache (joblib/pickle) for expensive computations; background warm-up task

- Safety and Validation

	- [ ] Extend JEDEC validation rules (clear messages; all primary timings covered)
	- [ ] Make “Safe Mode” the default; add Dry-Run preflight for live changes; highlight violations in UI

- AI Quick Wins (no API breaks)

	- [ ] Unify optimizer strategy behind a single interface (GA/RL/BO)
	- [ ] Add Pareto frontier view (bandwidth vs latency vs stability)
	- [ ] Add basic SHAP/feature importance for the regression predictor
	- [ ] Add uncertainty estimates and warm-start from known-good presets

Deliverables (end of Week 2):

- Measured cold-start improvement and a brief PERF.md with before/after numbers
- Safer defaults with preflight and clearer JEDEC violations
- AI tab with Pareto view and model interpretability toggle

### Ownership, Risks, and Mitigations

- Ownership (TBD): CI/Tooling, Installer, Performance, Safety, AI
- Risks: heavy dependency build failures on Windows; model/package incompatibilities; Streamlit caching edge cases
- Mitigations: ship offline wheels, pin known-good versions via `constraints.txt`, add feature flags to toggle new paths

### Next Actions (ready now)

- [ ] Approve this plan and I’ll: (1) add dev configs (pre-commit, mypy, flake8), (2) wire `requirements-dev.txt`, (3) prepare Inno/NSIS script and publish a draft EXE
