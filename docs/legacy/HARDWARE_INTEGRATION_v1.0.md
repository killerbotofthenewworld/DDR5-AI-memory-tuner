## 🧩 Technical Architecture

### Hardware Interface Layer

```python
class HardwareInterface:
    def initialize(self) -> bool
    def get_capabilities(self) -> HardwareCapabilities
    def apply_ddr5_settings(self, settings: dict) -> bool
    def create_backup(self) -> bool
    def emergency_restore(self) -> bool
    def monitor_stability(self) -> dict
```

### Live Tuning Integration

```python
class LiveHardwareTuner:
    def start_live_session(self, config) -> bool
    def apply_live_adjustment(self, param, value) -> bool
    def emergency_stop(self) -> bool
    def get_hardware_status(self) -> dict
```

## 📊 Safety Metrics

### Real-Time Monitoring

- Temperature Monitoring - CPU/Memory thermal state
- Voltage Stability - VDDQ/VPP regulation monitoring  
- Memory Stability - Error detection and correction
- Power Consumption - System power draw monitoring

### Safety Thresholds

- VDDQ Range: 1.0V - 1.4V (conservative: 1.05V - 1.35V)
- VPP Range: 1.8V - 2.0V (conservative: 1.85V - 1.95V)
- Temperature Limits: CPU < 80°C, Memory < 70°C
- Timing Constraints: DDR5 JEDEC specification compliance

## 🚧 Current Limitations
