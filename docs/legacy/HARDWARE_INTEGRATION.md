# 🚀 DDR5 AI Sandbox Simulator - Enhanced Hardware Integration

## ✅ YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### 🔍 1. Does it detect RAM in PC/Laptop?

YES! The simulator now includes comprehensive hardware detection:

- Real System Detection: Detects actual DDR5 modules installed in your system
- Multi-Platform Support: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Detailed Information: Shows manufacturer, capacity, speed, part numbers, and more
- Cross-Reference Database: Matches detected modules with specifications database

### 🗃️ 2. Does it have access to a database with RAM info?

YES! We've implemented a comprehensive DDR5 database:

- 11 Real DDR5 Modules from major manufacturers (Corsair, G.Skill, Kingston, etc.)
- Complete Specifications: Timings, voltages, overclocking potential, pricing
- Filter & Search: By manufacturer, speed, capacity, and more
- Real Part Numbers: Actual SKUs from Corsair Dominator, G.Skill Trident Z5, etc.
- Performance Data: Chip types (Samsung B-die, Micron, SK Hynix), OC potential

### ⚡ 3. Can this really tune DDR5 RAM in its current state?

PARTIALLY - Here's the honest answer:

What it can do:

- AI-Powered Optimization: Generate optimal timing configurations
- Real Hardware Detection: Identify your actual DDR5 modules
- Database Matching: Load real-world specifications for your RAM
- Stability Prediction: AI-based stability and performance forecasting
- Educational Value: Learn optimal timings for manual BIOS application

What it cannot do:

- Direct Hardware Control: Cannot automatically apply settings to BIOS/UEFI
- Real-Time Tuning: No direct interface with memory controllers
- Automatic Application: Settings must be manually entered in BIOS

To actually tune your DDR5:

1. Use the AI to find optimal settings
2. Write down the recommended timings
3. Restart and enter BIOS/UEFI
4. Navigate to memory/overclocking settings
5. Manually input the AI-optimized values
6. Test stability with MemTest86 or similar
