## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive improvement plan for the DDR5 AI Sandbox Simulator, focusing on enhancing AI capabilities, testing, documentation, and user experience.

## 🔜 Next Improvements (Next 7 Days)

Short, high-impact tasks to execute immediately. Non-breaking and testable.

1. Quality + Tooling

- [ ] Pre-commit hooks (black, flake8, isort). Acceptance: `pre-commit run -a` passes locally.
- [ ] Mypy on `src/` core modules. Acceptance: `mypy src` passes with no new ignores.
- [ ] Coverage gate 80% in CI. Acceptance: CI fails under 80%, uploads HTML report.

1. Windows Installer polish

- [ ] Add offline wheels cache for heavy deps (torch) and a Repair option. Acceptance: fresh VM install completes offline; Repair executes without errors.
- [ ] Code signing integration doc + checksum in Releases. Acceptance: release assets include `.sha256` and signing notes.

1. Performance quick wins

- [ ] Lazy-import heavy modules (torch/plotly) in Streamlit tabs. Acceptance: cold start reduced by >20% on Windows.
- [ ] On-disk cache for expensive predictions (joblib). Acceptance: warmed start shows >50% faster model inference.

1. Safety defaults

- [ ] Safe Mode default + Dry-Run preflight required for live tuning. Acceptance: UI blocks live actions until preflight passes.
- [ ] Extend JEDEC validations and clearer messages. Acceptance: tests cover CL/tRCD/tRP/tRAS/tRC/tRFC relations.

1. AI quick wins

- [ ] Pareto view (bandwidth vs latency vs stability). Acceptance: chart renders with sample data; toggle in AI tab.
- [ ] SHAP/feature importance for regression predictor (fast path). Acceptance: optional toggle; renders bar plot.

1. Docs

- [ ] Quick Start (Windows installer-focused) in README. Acceptance: steps tested on clean Windows user account.
- [ ] docs/TESTING.md updated with property tests and safety checks. Acceptance: includes copy-paste commands and expected outputs.

Notes

- No breaking API changes. All items validated by unit tests or a small manual smoke run.

## �🛠️ 2025 Q3 Upgrade Execution Plan (Next 2 Weeks)

This section turns the roadmap into an actionable, time-bound plan. Dates assume start week of Aug 11, 2025. Adjust as needed.

### Week 1: Foundation, CI, and Installer Hardening

- CI/CD and Quality Gates
    - [ ] Validate existing workflow at `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` and set required checks on PRs
    - [ ] Add local quality tooling: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `mypy.ini`, `.flake8` (align with CI)
    - [ ] Introduce `requirements-dev.txt` (pytest, black, flake8, mypy, bandit, safety) and optional `constraints.txt`
    - [ ] Enable coverage artifact upload and failing threshold in CI (soft-fail today → hard-fail >2 weeks)

- Windows Installer (real, easy, robust)
    - [ ] Promote current per-user installer to a signed EXE via Inno Setup or NSIS (keeps venv layout)
    - [ ] Bundle an offline wheels cache for heavy deps (torch, torchvision, opencv) to reduce install flakiness)
    - [ ] Add a “Repair” option and better logs; ensure Start Menu/Uninstall entries are present and reliable
    - [ ] Document code signing workflow and publish checksum in Releases

Deliverables (end of Week 1):

- Green CI on main for 3.9–3.12, pre-commit ready for contributors
- Windows EXE installer artifact attached to a draft GitHub Release, with install/uninstall verified

### Week 2: Performance, Safety, and AI Quick Wins

- Performance and Startup
    - [ ] Profile cold start; lazy-import heavy modules; cache static datasets (e.g., databases under `src/`)
    - [ ] Add a simple on-disk cache (joblib/pickle) for expensive computations; background warm-up task

- Safety and Validation
    - [ ] Extend JEDEC validation rules (clear messages; all primary timings covered)
    - [ ] Make “Safe Mode” the default; add Dry-Run preflight for live changes; highlight violations in UI

- AI Quick Wins (no API breaks)
    - [ ] Unify optimizer strategy behind a single interface (GA/RL/BO)
    - [ ] Add Pareto frontier view (bandwidth vs latency vs stability)
    - [ ] Add basic SHAP/feature importance for the regression predictor
    - [ ] Add uncertainty estimates and warm-start from known-good presets

Deliverables (end of Week 2):

- Measured cold-start improvement and a brief PERF.md with before/after numbers
- Safer defaults with preflight and clearer JEDEC violations
- AI tab with Pareto view and model interpretability toggle

## 🔝 Prioritized Improvements (Roadmap You Can Track)

1. Release & Distribution

- Ensure GHCR push works (enable org publishing or use PAT); publish immutable version tags and latest
- Code-sign Windows installer; optionally publish to WinGet
- Automate release notes and attach installer + SBOM artifacts

1. CI/CD Hardening

- Multi-arch images (amd64 now; arm64 when torch wheels available)
- Add vulnerability scanning (Trivy/Grype) and Dependabot
- Cache Python wheels in Docker builds; slim layers

1. Testing & Validation

- Add docs/TESTING.md with steps and sample outputs
- Property tests for JEDEC invariants; optimizer determinism (seeded)
- Streamlit import smoke test; performance regression thresholds
- Mypy stricter checks on core modules

1. AI/Optimizer Upgrades

- Add Bayesian/Optuna tuner; early stopping by convergence
- Reward shaping with explicit safety penalties for violations
- Experiment tracking (MLflow/W&B) for metrics and artifacts
- Warm-start search from known-good presets

1. Product/UX

- One-click “Safe Optimize”; guarded “Advanced” toggles
- Profile save/load; JSON export; clearly mark simulated XMP export
- Results dashboard with stability bands and baseline deltas
- Guided tutorial integration and Quick Start for Windows

1. Simulation/Performance

- Vectorize hot paths; optional Numba
- Memoize calculations and add thermal model parameters

1. Security & Supply Chain

- Generate SBOM (Syft) for Docker and installer
- Sign images (cosign) and add provenance (SLSA/GitHub OIDC)
- CI scanning with gating on severity thresholds

## ⏱️ Immediate Actions (This Week)

- Verify GHCR push (enable org publishing or switch to PAT login)
- Add docs/TESTING.md and new tests:
    - JEDEC invariants (property-based)
    - Optimizer seeded determinism
- Add a Quick Start to README (Windows installer usage)
- Add release notes template and changelog generation

## 30/60/90 Plan

- 30: GHCR stable, tests expanded, Quick Start + Testing docs, automated release notes
- 60: Optuna tuner, profile export/load, signed installer + SBOMs, basic image signing
- 90: Multi-arch images, experiment tracking, perf optimizations, polished UX for safe/advanced flows

### Ownership, Risks, and Mitigations

- Ownership (TBD): CI/Tooling, Installer, Performance, Safety, AI
- Risks: heavy dependency build failures on Windows; model/package incompatibilities; Streamlit caching edge cases
- Mitigations: ship offline wheels, pin known-good versions via `constraints.txt`, add feature flags to toggle new paths

### Next Actions (ready now)

- [ ] Approve this plan and I’ll: (1) add dev configs (pre-commit, mypy, flake8), (2) wire `requirements-dev.txt`, (3) prepare Inno/NSIS script and publish a draft EXE
